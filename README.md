# Weather App

An app which displays the current weather of any city in the world, as well as a five-day forecast.

## The problem

The first point of action was to successfully fetch the data from OpenWeatherMap. I looked at their  API to see what information which could be extracted, and selected a few points of data which I would want to use in my app. 

After I figured out how to do populate the DOM with data, I started with the styling part. For this, I used Figma, where I also documented my process. See it [here](https://www.figma.com/file/GpbiZuim0lWaqhj3KGM3ZZ/Weather-application?node-id=0%3A1). 

### If I had more time...
The remaining backlog items are: 

* Show days instead of dates in the forecast.
* Sunset and sunrise in local times.
* Improve experience on smaller devices (Only had an iPhone X to test on).
* Add geolocation feature.
* Add dark mode (if the user is looking at the app after sunset).
* More weather images.
